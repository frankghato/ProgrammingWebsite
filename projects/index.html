        <h3>Twitch Alert Handler</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/frankghato/TwitchAlertHandler" class="demoLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Repository</a>
        <p>This project uses the Streamlabs API and JavaScript to update an HTML document in response to Twitch alerts.</p>
        <h4>Motivation Behind Project</h4>
        <p>I created this application because I wanted to give Twitch streamers the ability to easily make their streams more interactive. This application allows streamers to create overlay elements that will interact with alerts and react and change based on the number of alerts.</p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <p>The base version of this project features three different elements that react to alerts differently. The three elements are represented by the Pokemon Chikorita, Totodile, and Cyndaquil. Chikorita and its evolutions react to every type of alert with an attack animation and evolve based on the total number of all alerts. Totodile will react to subscription alerts and will evolve based on the total number of subscriptions accrued. Cyndaquil will react specifically to donation alerts and will evolve based on the dollar amount accrued. On the first day of each month the three Pokemon reset to their base forms.</p>
        <p>Development Status: Completed</p>
